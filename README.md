Instructions:
Welcome to our Frontend Web Development assignment! We are excited to see your skills in action. In this assignment, you will be working on building a 3D editable canvas platform using technologies such as HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and Three.js. Additionally, you will be required to integrate APIs to enable data exchange and backend functionality.

Task:
You are required to create a web application that allows users to interact with a 3D canvas platform. The platform should allow users to draw and manipulate 3D shapes using the provided tools. Users should also be able to save and load their canvas creations. Furthermore, the application should interact with external APIs to fetch and display data related to the canvas elements.

Requirements:
1. The canvas platform should be built using React.js and Next.js for server-side rendering.
2. Use TypeScript for all your code to ensure type safety and maintainability.
3. Implement the 3D graphics and interactivity using Three.js library.
4. Design a user-friendly and visually appealing interface using HTML and CSS.
5. Integrate at least one external API to fetch data related to the canvas elements.
6. Provide options for users to save and load their canvas creations.
7. Ensure the application is responsive and works flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
